# Arduino Thermostat
Don't be mislead by the title;  this does not control the amount of heat in your home. However, it is a program that controls the display that is usually next to the thermo-controls. You can replace your average black and white thermostat-display with a TFT lcd and install this program.
# Requirements
In order for this to work, you need to get:
* An arduino Mega 2560 (ATmega cpu)
* A 2.8 inch TFT LCD by Elegoo
* A DHT11 Sensor
* 3 Jumper Wires (Male or Female, depends on how you want to implement it)
# Software Requirements
You will also need some libraries for this to work:

* Elegoo TFT Library
